Using the **Applied Time Series Analysis** textbook as a reference, traditional time series methods were applied to forecast the wind power generation of Long Yuan. The project utilized wind power data from the preliminary and regional competitions. Traditional time series forecasting methods were implemented both theoretically and programmatically to predict power generation. The predictions were then analyzed to demonstrate the principles and characteristics of different time series models.

Using the **PaddleTS** library, an LSTM-based deep learning model was constructed to forecast Long Yuan's wind power generation. A multifunctional visualization website was developed to provide end-to-end services, including data upload, preprocessing, power forecasting, and performance evaluation.  

**Key Features of the Website**:  
1. Visualization of wind power data and basic statistics.  
2. Power generation forecasting for 20 wind turbines, with visualized predictions and performance evaluation.  
3. Allowing users to upload wind power data, forecast power generation, and visualize results.  
4. Deep learning-based LSTM forecasting method.  
5. Parameter tuning, forecasting, visualization, and performance evaluation using 10 different traditional time series models.  
6. Integrated models allowing users to choose and tune models for power forecasting, visualization, and performance evaluation.  
7. Supporting user-uploaded models for forecasting, visualization, and performance evaluation.
